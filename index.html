										<h3>Business goal validation</h3>
										<p>We know the world changes and, in order to be competetive, so must your software. That’s why we invented continuous validation. It’s vital to know that your goals are still achieved after changing parts of the software. Sometimes one feature makes another unneeded. If so, with continuous validation you'll know. <br><a href="/getgareth.github.io/objectives.html">Read more...</a></p>

										<h3>Requirements validation</h3>
										<p>It is hard to create and maintain an overview of the input that is so determinative for the end result. Because crap in means almost always crap out. We like to help by measuring the backlog quality so we can be sure this is in order. <br><a href="/getgareth.github.io/input.html">Read more...</a></p>

										<h3>Real-time reporting</h3>
										<p>Are the assumptions you made valid? Are all the backlogs in order? Does the product make the desired impact? No need to worry. Gareth will let you know! Gareth measures both the input and the outcomes of your products and reports these.</p>

											<h2>Get Gareth. Get feedback.</h2>
											<p>
															Gareth is all about feedback. Gareth will alert you when an assumption is not
															right or is not right anymore due to a change in the software.
															These are the things we can really benefit from. We are now able to decide to adjust the
															feature or maybe completely remove it based on evidence.
															There is no shame in removing features that do not give the results you where
															expecting.
