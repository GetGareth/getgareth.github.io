								<h3>Why</h3>
								<p>There is a lot of focus on software craftsmanship and automation. We can build and deploy software very quickly with current technologies. However, it√≠s the post-deployment stage that worries us. How can we be sure that this new functionality has the impact the business needs?</p>

								<h3>How</h3>
								<p>With Gareth the product owner describes the goal that should be achieved: the experiment. By setting a baseline (getting the current situation), an assumption (the desired future situation) and a time within which the goal should reached we have all the information needed to validate the goal.</p>

								<h3>What</h3>
								<p>Gareth will run these validations as often as described in the assumptions and take the appropriate action. It is a great way for a product owner to be sure the right things are being built and kept that way. This is what we want to communicate to our stakeholders.</p>

									<h2>Get Gareth. Get feedback.</h2>
									<p>
													Gareth is all about feedback. Gareth will alert you when an assumption is not
													right or is not right anymore due to a change in the software.
													These are the things we can really benefit from. We are now able to decide to adjust the
													feature or maybe completely remove it based on evidence.
													There is no shame in removing features that do not give the results you where
													expecting.
