                  <p>We know the world changes and, in order to be competitive, so must your software. That’s why we invented continuous validation. It’s vital to make sure that your goals are still achieved after changing parts of your software. Sometimes a new feature makes another no longer needed. With continuous validation you'll know when that is the case.</p>
