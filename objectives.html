						<h2>Unused features are waste</h2>
						<p>
							Studies show that in some cases only 20% of software products is used always/often by the users. 80% percent of the functionality is used rarely to never. This ratio can only occur when there is no validation of how users are using the product. In these cases there is no feedback taken from users or is the feedback not prosessed

						<h2>Unused code is a costly waste</h2>
						<p>
							Maintenance of software is costly and should be taken seriously in account in the product lifecycle. While maintenance is necessary in order to maintain and sustain software products, maintenance of code from unused features is a pure waste. Continuous validation helps in detecting unused features and makes it possible to keep validating these features after changing them.

							<h2>Why</h2>
							<p>There is a lot of focus on software craftsmanship and automation. We can build and deploy software very quickly with current technologies. However, it√≠s the post-deployment stage that worries us. How can we be sure that this new functionality has the impact the business needs?</p>
						</section>

					<div class="4u">
						<section class="special">
							<h2>How</h2>
							<p>Every change or new functionality should be related to one or more business goals. By describing these in a natural language Gareth is able to validate the software. Not only the changed parts but also the features that are already in place.</p>
						</section>
					</div>
					<div class="4u">
						<section class="special">
							<h2>What</h2>
							<p>Gareth will run these validations as often as requested and takes the appropriate action. It is the way for a company to make sure the right product is being built and kept that way. This is what you want to communicate to your stakeholders.</p>
