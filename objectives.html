						<h2>Unused features are waste</h2>
						<p>
							Studies show that in some cases only 20% of software products is used always/often by the users. 80% percent of the functionality is used rarely to never. This ratio can only occur when there is no validation of how users are using the product. In these cases there is no feedback taken from users or is the feedback not prosessed

						<h2>Unused code is waste</h2>
						<p>
							Maintenance of software is costly and should be taken seriously in account in the product lifecycle. While maintenance is necessary in order to maintain and sustain software products, maintenance of code from unused features is a pure waste. Continuous validation helps in detecting unused features and makes it possible to keep validating these features after changing them.

							<h3>Why</h3>
							<p>There is a lot of focus on software craftsmanship and automation. We can build and deploy software very quickly with current technologies. However, it√≠s the post-deployment stage that worries us. How can we be sure that this new functionality has the impact the business needs?</p>

						<section class="special box">
							<img src="images/icons/GarethBuildIcon.png" class="lean-image"/>
							<h3>How</h3>
							<p>Every change or new functionality should be related to one or more business goals. By describing these in a natural language Gareth is able to validate the software. Not only the changed parts but also the features that are already in place.</p>

							<h3>What</h3>
							<p>Gareth will run these validations as often as requested and take the appropriate action. It is the way for a company to make sure the right product is being built and kept that way. This is what you want to communicate to your stakeholders.</p>

								<h2>Get Gareth. Get feedback.</h2>
								<p>
												Gareth is all about feedback. Gareth will alert you when an assumption is not
												right or is not right anymore due to a change in the software.
												These are the things we can really benefit from. We are now able to decide to adjust the
												feature or maybe completely remove it based on evidence.
												There is no shame in removing features that do not give the results you where
												expecting.
