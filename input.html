						<h2>Input equals output</h2>
						<p>
The beauty of an user story is that it describes a lot in little. An user story is an effective way of notating requirements. It describes the persona for which it will be made, the desired outcome and most importantly the problem that needs to be solved.
<br><br>
						But what if the stories on a backlog do not have this proper description? How can we expect the end result, the working software, to do what we expected? It is difficult to have an overview of the quality of a backlog and the statuses of multiple backlogs: the portfolio. This really inflicts with the task of building the best products.

						<h2>Configurable</h2>
						<p>
Gareth backlog validation is highly configurable. Multiple issue and project tracking systems like Jira, Trello, Github, Pivotal Tracker are supported with more coming. You can define different issue types and how they should be used. For each of these subject you can define the threshold or importance so the results reflects your desired way of working. This way you can be free to set up and enforce your own company conventions regarding to requirements the way you want to.
